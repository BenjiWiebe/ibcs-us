/*
 * IBCS used to be a kernel module, and is still written that way.
 * This file does what the Linux 2.6.32 include file <linux/fcntl.h>
 * did, but does it by emulating the same functions in user user space.
 *
 * These files are mostly derived / copied from the linux kernel source,
 * and so are covered by the same licence.
